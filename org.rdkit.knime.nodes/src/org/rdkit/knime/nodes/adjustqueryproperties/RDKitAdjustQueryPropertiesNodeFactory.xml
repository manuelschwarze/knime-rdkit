        <intro>
            This node allows common adjustments to the matching behavior of molecules that are intended to be used as queries.
            Structure searches based on queries molecules are not always leading to the desired results.
            Often some fine tuning of the query structure helps to increase the search results. RDKit
            offers query properties that can be set explicitly for query molecules to influence a search.
            This node lets the user define the properties to be adjusted.
