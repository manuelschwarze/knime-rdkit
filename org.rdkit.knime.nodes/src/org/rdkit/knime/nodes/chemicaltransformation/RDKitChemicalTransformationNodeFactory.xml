            Transforms a structure into another structure by applying several reactions provided as SMARTS values or Rxn Blocks.
            Every valid reaction found in table 2 will be applied multiple times to every input molecule in table 1. If the result
            does not change anymore for one reaction, the next one will be applied, and so on. Sometimes, a reaction could be
            applied forever. To avoid this scenario a maximal number of reaction cycles can be set. If a reaction fails in some cycle
            the failure will be ignored and the next reaction is being executed on the last successful product. At the very
            end after all reactions were applied the end product is being sanitized. If this sanitization fails for some reason
            the result cell will be empty.
